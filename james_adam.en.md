## Happy Birthday, Ruby!

I can still remember discovering Ruby, almost 16 years ago; the sense of delight, and excitement, that came from using a programming language which made it so _easy_ and so _fun_ to write programs that seemed to express themselves without effort.

From that day onwards, Ruby has been my language of choice. It's the best, most considerate blend of paradigms I've ever had the pleasure of using. It never chafes, and I'm always discovering new ways to build with it.

Though some of the community members, who helped and encouraged me during those early days, have moved on from the Ruby community, their spirits live on in the tools and software they gave back to us, and I'm confidence that they have also carried much of the playfulness and curiosity learned here onwards to their new desinations.

Even after Ruby is gone, the spirit of Ruby will live on in everyone who came to love it.
